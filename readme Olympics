# 120 Years of the Olympics Exploration

## athlete_events.csv Data Set
> I chose to explore a data set from Kaggle that held a 120 year history of the Olympics.
I’ve always enjoyed watching the games and felt like the data set would be fun to explore.
The data was gathered from the following link:

## Summary of Findings
> My purpose for exploring the Olympic Dataset was out of curiosity and a joy of watching the game.
I also wanted to use the analysis as a reference that I could look back on from time to time.
I wanted to learn about medal, country, and athlete characteristics,
what’s changed over time, differences between Summer and Winter Games, differences between sports, etc.

The U.S. has done very well over the countries time participating in the olympics.
They lead in participation, athlete counts, and medals.  The Soviet Union and Germany
are the next closest competitors.

Weight, Height, Age, BMI and Time are a big portion of the exploratory analysis.
Several different outcomes and athlete characteristics were determined
by looking at the variables against one another.

Athletics is the most popular sport by far.  This consists of track and field
events. Swimming is the next sport in popularity.  Ice Hockey is the most popular
come winter time.

## Key Insights for Presentation
> For the presentation I focus on the visuals that focus on the variables mentioned
above, weight, height, BMI, gender, and Time.  The variables are plotted independently
and against one another for easy to see insights and trends.
